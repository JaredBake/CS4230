Diego: Test plan
Jared: Equivilance Classes
Maya: List of tests?

Obiously work on what you want to but these should be good starting spots

Turn in the following:
• Your source code (30)
• A working executable module. It must execute on other people’s PCs.
• Your test plan. (80) (Scope 5, Strategy 50, Resource 5, timeline 10, risk 10)
• A list of the tests you wrote. Indicate which were executed. (20)
• Addenda to the test plan, if appropriate.
• Changes, additions, or clarifications to the specifications you made.
• Instructions for using your program. (20)
Prepare a package as described below to give to your tester. You have the responsibility
to give it to your tester no later than one day after the due date.
Grading:
• The program has to work. After all, that is an indication of how good your testing
was.
• Your test plan should use an approach that is appropriate for the problem. It
should be well-thought-out and complete.
• Your test cases should be complete – I should not see any obvious areas you
missed.
